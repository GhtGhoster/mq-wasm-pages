# macroquad_web_template

edit build script
- take the correct directory/file/project name in the build script
- make it shut up about existing directories
- make it log progress (at least say something)
- add the html into the script itself (contains project name)
- attach the js file the html uses to the template itself
  (no online external dependencies other than cargo)
- add a local server (maybe python?)

make a script to rename the whole project

make both scripts in both ps1 and sh

add proper cargo.toml keys

add a read_me with instructions, description and credits
maybe rename repo to
  macroquad, wasm, wbindgen, github pages
